# Amgil Stun - An Educational Chatbot
 An educational chatbot created for a competetion in less than 48 hours.
 There are still many unfinished features and bugs that needs to be fixed and won't be any time soon.

## What does Amgil Stun offer?
 This chatbot was trained over physics and biology questions mainly (check model/intents.json to see all the available questions it can answer).
 Amgil Stun is not very smart yet but it works! Kind of...
 In case Amgil Stun cannot answer a question it uses OpenAI's API to get it's answer.

 Other than the AI, the app also provides a user friendly and customizable GUI, a cloud based account system where your chat history is stored and also a text to speech feature!

## Todo list (if I ever decide to come back to this)
- Auto adjust font colour on changing theme
- Change the palette colour when changed without restart
- Enhancing the AI model's accuracy
- Expanding the AI model's dataset to answer various other subjects
- Add support for Andriod & iOS
- Lag issues
- No line wrapping for long messages
